# PROG8245-25S-Sec1 Machine Learning Programming - Lab #2

## Synopsis

Please see my Lab #2 which demonstrates the 12-step Data Engineering road-map learned about in class. This project uses a generated e-commerce dataset with 500 rows to show the steps involved. It includes loading raw data, cleaning, transofrming, and adding features to the data. The updated dataset is then saved to JSON and Parquet files for review.

## Quickstart

Please begin by setting up a virtual environment and then running all cells in the Jupyter Notebook in sequence. To create your own virtual environment run the following code in the root directory:

`python -m venv venv`

The installation requirements are in the first cell of the notebook.

## Data-sources

The sales records data source was generated using ChatGPT. I then wrote a bit of code to aggregate the coupon codes and manually created the coupon codes set with the codes used from sales records and some amounts I chose to match the codes.
